# PySyncroNet - Advanced PDF Project Manager

## Project Description

**PySyncroNet** is an advanced software solution for **secure sharing and archiving of software projects**. Thanks to its innovative architecture, it can convert entire folders containing source code into a single **readable and portable PDF document**, which can later be **fully reconstructed** back into its original structure.

The PDF format not only ensures security and compatibility but also provides a powerful advantage: generated PDFs can be **used as input for Artificial Intelligence (AI) models**, enabling semantic analysis, automated code reviews, and NLP model training on source code.

## Key Features

* ✨ **Project → PDF Conversion**
  Generates a detailed PDF document from a project folder, including source code, configuration files, and hierarchical structure, with line numbering and indentation preservation.

* 🔄 **Project Reconstruction → Folder**
  Faithfully rebuilds the original project from the generated PDF, maintaining filenames, indentation, and structure.

* ⚙️ **Advanced Exclusion Management**
  Allows exclusion of specific directories (e.g., *venv*, *.git*, *node_modules*), individual files, or unwanted binary extensions.

* 🔍 **Modern Graphical Interface (GUI)**
  Built with **Tkinter**, featuring a dark theme, multiple tabs (PDF Creation, Reconstruction, Exclusions, Settings), and an interactive logging system.

* ⏳ **Background Processing**
  Heavy operations run on separate *threads* to keep the GUI responsive.

* 🔒 **Security and AI-Ready**
  All binary files are automatically excluded, making the PDFs not only safe to share but also **ready for AI-based analysis** (LLMs, chatbots, code analyzers, etc.).

## Software Architecture

### 1. `folder_to_pdf.py`

Handles **project-to-PDF conversion** with accurate layout and multi-encoding support (UTF-8, Latin-1, etc.). Each file is represented in the PDF with line numbers and preserved indentation.

### 2. `pdf_to_folder.py`

Handles **project reconstruction from PDF** with intelligent file section recognition. Supports both `PyPDF2` and `pdfplumber` for accurate and compatible parsing.

### 3. `syncroNet.py`

The core of the application, featuring a multi-tab GUI interface, project management tools, logging system, and exclusion settings.

---

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3.8+**
* **Tkinter** for the GUI
* **FPDF** and **PyPDF2** for PDF handling
* **Threading**, **pathlib**, **os**, **re** for application logic

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PySyncroNet.git
   cd PySyncroNet
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install fpdf PyPDF2
   ```

3. Launch the application:

   ```bash
   python syncroNet.py
   ```

## Usage

### 🔄 PDF Creation

1. Select the project folder
2. (Optionally) set exclusions
3. Click **"Create PDF"** to generate the project documentation

### 🔄 Reconstruction from PDF

1. Select a previously generated PDF
2. Choose an output folder
3. Click **"Rebuild Project"** to reconstruct the original structure

## AI Integration

The use of the PDF format as the primary output is not only a security choice but also a strategic one for **AI tool integration**.
PDFs generated by PySyncroNet:

* Are **readable by language models** (such as GPT or Claude) for automated code analysis;
* Enable **AI-assisted code reviews, audits, and refactoring**;
* Can be used as structured datasets for **training or fine-tuning** models based on source code.

---

## Main Advantages

* Eliminates risks from malware or malicious executables
* Universal compatibility through the PDF format
* Ideal for archiving, documentation, and AI analysis
* Faithful and verifiable project reconstruction
